    <h2>Typing</h2>
    <p>I took an interest in typing because of my middle school teachers. When I joined the ATM Program they both taught me how to type without my looking at my fingers. I rapidly gained speed in my typing and I didn't look at my fingers. I am currently in the range of 70-78 words per minute and am looking forward to typing even faster.</p>

    <h2>Making Websites</h2>
    <p>I have recently been taught how to make websites by one of my ATM teachers as well and the fact that you just have to type out things to make a whole new thing is amazing to me. The fact that technology can do this is something that fascinates me. I like making websites because, like other brilliant minds out there, I can now show my talent in website making.</p>

    <h2>Photoshop</h2>
    <p>Photoshop is something I learned in 7th grade and it's really fun to play around with. You can change many things in a photo and I also like it because a lot of photographers use it. An interest and skill in photoshop has been brought to my attention because personally, I want to be a photographer as well, and since some photos need to be fixed up, Adobe Photoshop would be my go to.</p>
