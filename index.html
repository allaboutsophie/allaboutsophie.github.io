		<h1>All About Me</h1>
		
		<h2>My Skills</h2>
		<p>I am particularly skilled in:</p>
		<ul>
			<h5><li><a href="http://www.freetypinggame.net/free-typing-test.asp">Typing</a></li></h5>
			<h5><li><a href="https://dash.generalassemb.ly/yungsophh/build-your-own-blog-theme">Making Websites</a></li></h5>
			<h5><li><a href="https://itconnect.uw.edu/learn/workshops/online-tutorials/graphics-and-design-workshops/adobe-cs/photoshop/">Photoshop</a></li></h5>

		</ul>
		<h2>Typing</h2>
			<p>I took an interest in typing because of my middle school teachers. When I joined the ATM Program they both taught me how to type without my looking at my fingers. I rapidly gained speed in my typing and I didn't look at my fingers. I am currently in the range of 70-78 words per minute and am looking forward to typing even faster.</p>
		<h2>Making Websites</h2>
			<p>I have recently been taught how to make websites by one of my ATM teachers as well and the fact that you just have to type out things to make a whole new thing is amazing to me. The fact that technology can do this is something that fascinates me. I like making websites because, like other brilliant minds out there, I can now show my talent in website making.</p>
		<h2>Photoshop</h2>
			<p>Photoshop is something I learned in 7th grade and it's really fun to play around with. You can change many things in a photo and I also like it because a lot of photographers use it. An interestand skill in photoshop has been brought to my attention because personally, I want to be a photographer as well, and since some photos need to be fixed up, Adobe Photoshop would be my go to.</p>
				
		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p> I really don’t like actually playing in teams for a sport. I’d rather play just for fun because I’m shy. Even though I’m shy I really do enjoy playing volleyball and going to football/baseball games with my dad.</p>

		<h2>Volleyball</h2>
			<p>	While most museums are a collection of old artifacts and stuff that no one is really interested in seeing, our musuems are the best of the best.</p>
			<p>	You won't find anything like these any where else in the world. Our museums rival that of our closest competitors including the Museum of Bad Art, the Paris Sewers Musuem and the Museum of Broken Relationships.</p>
			<p>	Come check them out...the fun is waiting for you.</p>

		<h2>Football</h2>
			<p>The Green Bay Packers are one of my favorites because in my opinion, they play really good. I would love to go to one of their games some day, it would be a really fun day.</p>

		<h2>Baseball</h2>
			<p>The Dodgers are my favorite team. They are a team of Los Angeles like the Angels but in my opinion the Dodgers are more skilled. I've gone to 2 of their games and I have been fascinated on how they play. My favorite player of the team is Corey Seager.</p>
