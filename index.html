    <h2>Typing</h2>
    <p>I took an interest in typing because of my middle school teachers. When I joined the ATM Program they both taught me how to type without my looking at my fingers. I rapidly gained speed in my typing and I didn't look at my fingers. I am currently in the range of 70-78 words per minute and am looking forward to typing even faster.</p>

    <h2>Making Websites</h2>
    <p>I have recently been taught how to make websites by one of my ATM teachers as well and the fact that you just have to type out things to make a whole new thing is amazing to me. The fact that technology can do this is something that fascinates me. I like making websites because, like other brilliant minds out there, I can now show my talent in website making.</p>

    <h2>Photoshop</h2>
    <p>Photoshop is something I learned in 7th grade and it's really fun to play around with. You can change many things in a photo and I also like it because a lot of photographers use it. An interest and skill in photoshop has been brought to my attention because personally, I want to be a photographer as well, and since some photos need to be fixed up, Adobe Photoshop would be my go to.</p>

	<h2>Photography</h2>
	<p>I took an interest in photography and succeed in it as well because I am very passionate of taking a photography class. What I would love to do at the same though, is learn by myself and not be taught what to do by other people. Although other people's help may be benificial, I would like to learn photography in my own ways and figure things out as I learn more by myself.</p>

	<h2>Volleyball</h2>
	<p>Volleyball is one of my favorite sports. I've been told by the school team that I should join the volleyball team because they think I'm good at the game. Personally, I think I'm good too but not as good for me to be on the team. I think I should practice a little more and join next year (2018) or something. Even though I love volleyball and I love playing it, I never build up the courage to push myself into trying out for the team or any other sport team because I'm shy.</p>
