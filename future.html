		<h1>My Future</h1>
		
		<h2>Highschool</h2>
		<p>I would love to go to <a href="http://www.lblakewood.schoolloop.com/">Lakewood High School</a>, their programs are very impresive and give a very good idea on what your future would be like.</p>
		<h2>College!</h2>

			<p><a href="http://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> would be a good university/college for me because of the fact that it is in California itself. I wouldn't have to leave my family here and go somewhere too far away from family. I can take a drive back and forth every week or so from home and go back to my dorm.</p>
		<h2>Career Interests</h2>

		<h2>SplashAnyone Waterpark</h2>
			<p>	Our waterpark is the biggest and best park in the Western World. Just south of interstate 2015, you'll find a sweet mix of Super Slides and lazy rivers.</p>
			<p>	If that wasn't enough, we have 376 of the best food trucks in the state serving everything from fried gummy bears to lemonade and pizza. Don't forget if you buy our collectors edition souvenir water park keepsake, you get free refills all year!</p>
			<p> And we wouldn't be SplashAnyone without the rules about splashing ... wait there are no rules.</p>

		<h2>Best Zoo in Town</h2>
			<p>	Finally, you won't want to miss out cuddly little zoo animals. Lions, tigers and bears...Oh My! We have the largest selection of born in captivity animals. We didn't want to take the from their natural habitat, so we just got them from the other zoos in the state.</p>
